# dnsmap, a simple subdomain bruteforcer

This is the project page of the new version of dnsmap which has been ported from C to python by its original author. The [old version](https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/dnsmap) should no longer be used.

See an example command below. Yup, it's that simple! ðŸ˜œ
